CSE Attendance Bot

This bot should be activated by downloading all files, along with the discord API (https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html) and the asyncio module in python (https://pypi.org/project/asyncio/)

To activate the bot, run the 'main.py' file. It will tell you that the bot is now online

Then, use the __$timetable__ command to prompt a direct message where you can upload your CSE timetable from RHUL (format specified)
After that, you've been added to the list of users!

The bot will automatically run it's check every 30 minutes
And if you're supposed to have a lecture it'll remind you, and if you don't, it won't!

(For server managers, please make sure everybody has added their timetable using the __$timetable__ command prior to their first lecture for a better success rate)
